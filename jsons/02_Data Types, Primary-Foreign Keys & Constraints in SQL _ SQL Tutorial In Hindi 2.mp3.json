data from database"}], "text": " Before that, let's talk about the structure of a database So, you can see that SQL has a database and tables are stored in that database It can be one table or multiple tables It depends on your requirement And we store data in those tables which are in the form of rows and columns So, you can see rows and columns here And if I explain it through an example So, on the right side, you can see an employee table And in this employee table, all the values that you can see vertically are called columns And all the horizontal values are called rows So, just like in Excel, it is the same It also has rows and columns So, it has a total of 5 columns Like employee ID, its name, department, age and gender And below that, there are values in rows And the whole database structure is called RDBMS Relational Database Management So, in the relational database management system there are many tools that you can use to create a database or run SQL queries So, as I told you, there can be many tables in a database And those tables are connected to each other Whether it is through the primary key or the foreign key So, we will understand what is the primary and foreign key in a while But before that, let me show you an example of a typical database So, you can see this, we call it a database diagram So, a database diagram is made before you create a database When you have a requirement that you have to store which type of data in the database How many columns will be made or what type of data will be there According to that, you design this table And you connect those tables to each other So that in the future, if you have to do any analysis Or if you have to do any operation, then you can pull data from each other And finally, you can get the outcome you want So, you can see in this, you can call it an e-commerce database Or you can call it the data of an online retail website So, this is just for the purpose of example The actual database has many more tables For example, you can see only 6 tables in this So, you can see that the first table is of order items And there are 3 columns in this Order id, product id and quantity Now, suppose I want to know who has ordered this So, what I will do for that First of all, I have an order id I will see that there is another table which has orders In that also, id is used If you see here, there is a line which shows that both the tables are connected So, what I will do is, I will take the user id from the order table And with the help of this user id, I will take the user table If you see here, this user id is matched with the user table id Means, it is linked So, it means that this table is also connected So, if I go here, I will get the complete user's family Like, what is the name of the user, what is his email, what is his gender And all the other information is in the tables So, let's see what are data types So, whenever you define a column in a table So, before that, you have to tell what values will come in this column And what values you are going to fill in it So, according to that, you define the data type So, whatever data type is there, you define it For example, suppose you are making a customer database So, first of all, you will put the customer id in that So, the id will be, if you are keeping it in 1, 2, 3, 4 numeric So, you can tell the data type, which is integer Means, numbers will come in it So, let's see what is the theoretical definition of data type So, data type of a column defines what value the column can store in a table So, this is your data type And generally, when we make a table Then only, we declare the data type of all the columns After that, we classify the data types in 3 categories And there are many data types in it So, first of all, comes your string data type So, what are the most used data types in it? That is character, char And where char means varying character So, we will see the definition of this in the next slide Second comes your data type, numeric In which you use integer, float, and bool So, in data on time, you will understand that there are data types related to date and time So, now let's see them in detail The most commonly used data types, which we saw earlier In that, int comes Int has full form for integer values So, if you are keeping 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. So, we use int for that And float is used for decimal numbers Like 1.02, 1.5 So, if it has decimal numbers, then we use float for that And bool is used for boolean values If you want to put true or false values So, we use bool for that Next comes char, which is a fixed length So, we use char for that And then, we have char for the bool Next comes char, which is a fixed length string And you can put numbers in it You can put letters in it And you can put special characters in it So, char is used a lot For example, if you want to write someone's mail id So, it will have an at the rate symbol Or someone has written 100 score Someone has put a dot So, you can easily store all those things in char And where char is the same as char But it has a varying character length Next comes your date So, you can obviously store dates in this So, the format of date is First comes year, full year, which is 2022 Then comes month and then date And the date time is Obviously, it is like date but it has time Your time will be in the format of Hours, minutes and seconds Now, let's talk about Primary keys and foreign keys Primary key is a unique column So, it helps you To fetch data from your table So, For example, I gave you a customer So, we will keep the customer id unique Means, the id I gave you Can't be repeated with anyone else So, it becomes a unique id So, we can call it primary key Or if I give you an example of a school So, in a school, there is a class There can be two people with the same name But their roll number won't be the same So, the roll number can be called primary key And in this, You can see the second point That the table has only one primary key Generally, it is considered as best practice But it is unique and not null Not null means, it has some values It won't be empty Because any child in a school Can't be without a roll number So, it will have a roll number So, it is not null and unique Then comes the foreign key Foreign key is actually those columns in the table Which help you to connect With other tables So, we saw an example in the starting That the table of order Is connecting with the user So, the one which was connecting On the basis of id, you can call it foreign key You can see that Foreign keys can have duplicate values And can also have null values Next comes the constraints So, when you fill the data in the table You refine some rules on it And we call those rules as constraints So, these rules help you For data accuracy and reliability So, for example, I will tell you As I told you, the primary key Column is the customer id Or the roll number of the child So, the roll number should never be blank So, suppose someone is feeding data In the database If he leaves blank, by mistake He will not take the data, he will throw the error And will not feed the data in the system So, to save this type of error We use constraints There are many other uses We will see that in the example We generally declare the constraints With the create table statement You can see the syntax So, the table has a name Then column, then data type And finally, the constraint So, if you want You can put constraints in all columns Or if you don't want to put, you can put null values You can leave it blank So, now we will see Some commonly used constraints So, first is not null We have seen that you can't leave blank values Or null values Second is unique So, unique means that No repeated values can come in it No duplicate values can come Then comes the primary We have seen that it is a unique column So, in this, you have a combination of unique and not null Then comes foreign Foreign is also very important for you Because this column will help you To link from other tables That's why it is written here Prevent actions that would destroy links between the tables So, this is very important Then comes constraint check You can put a condition in it That values should be positive Or values should be greater than this So, you can do all this with the help of check constraint Then comes default constraint You can use this a lot Default means that if someone is leaving blank You can put default name in it Then comes create index This index is 0, 1, 2, 3 on the left side So, this create index creates numbers So that you can easily identify rows And later you can retrieve data from database"}
