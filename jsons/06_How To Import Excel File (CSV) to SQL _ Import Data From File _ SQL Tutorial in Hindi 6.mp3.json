let's go to SQL To import data from CSV file we need to create a table and table will have the same rows as CSV file which you need to import So first I create a table create table and name it Customer so first you see Customer ID Customer ID and I am giving data type int8 and after this you have first name and after that last name and after that email and after that last is address id and I am giving int8 Now let's create a table Ok so finally this query is successful So our table is created If you want to see table you can write importing from customer and run Now you see 5 columns are named Now let's import data For import we use copy command and here comes your table name and after that columns name will be here and after that from where you want to copy this data I have kept it in F drive and file name is customer.csv and after that delimiter because this is CSV file and comma will be here and CSV header so I want to keep same header so let's run you see query return successful means it is run now let's check select everything from customer you see here 15 rows of data all the data is here in 5 columns so this way you can import data one is through query if you want to import data without query in postgresql there is another method I am going to create a payment table which has 4 columns let's run query is successful now go to schemas after going to schemas you will see table here you see payment table if you can't see then go to refresh then table will be here now go to payment tab right click here you will see import export data click on it when you want to export file you will click on export now I want to import and my file is in F drive and file name is payment.csv format will be CSV and encoding will be UTF-8 this is standard encoding of CSV file and other option is I want header to be same you can see in this file there are 4 columns customer id, amount, mod and payment date ok here you can see successfully completed now let's run query select everything payment you can see here date is here so you can import file like this"}
