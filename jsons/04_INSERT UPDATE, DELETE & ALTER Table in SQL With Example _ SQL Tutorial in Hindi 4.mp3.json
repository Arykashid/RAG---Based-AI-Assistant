see here, insert into, whatever is the name of the table, you can put it The columns you have made, when you were making the table, you can put the name of the columns here Columns will be named, after that you have to write values, so it will come inside the bracket And then all the respective, like column 1's value will come here, column 2's value will come here, column 3's Now you can put those values and then execute it So let's see an example, this will be the query of your insert values, in which we will use insert into statement So here you can see, insert into, the name of the table is customer, so the name of our table is customer You have to take care of spelling in this and it is case sensitive, if you have written C capital, then C should be capital here also, it is case sensitive After that whatever columns are there, customer id, customer name, age, city, so if you do not remember the columns, then you right click here, go to the drop down Here you will see columns, you go to the drop down of columns, here you will see, customer id, customer name, age, city, salary All columns will come, after that values of all columns, so I am feeding 4 values at a time Keep one thing in mind, first customer id, then name, then name will come in values If age is there, then age will come 26, if city is there, then Delhi city will come, if salary is there, then salary will come at the end Similarly, all the values you will put in the bracket, all will be the same Now let's run it So you will see that query return successful, so our query is run Now I will check whether data came in our table or not, so for that what we will do, select, star, from, and we will write the name of the table Ok, the name of the table is now our customer, now you run it So you will see that we have put only 4 values, it is showing 4 values here, so in this way you can insert values Next comes that if you want to update the values in the table, then we use the update command So you can see that update command is used to update the existing values in the table So you can update the values in the rows, so the syntax of this is named update table In that you set the name of the column, whatever values you want to put in it, you put them Column 2, if there is any other column, put its values And at the end, you have to put a where clause and define its id, for which id you are changing all the values Ok, so now we will see the example, so here we have written the query, update customer After that we have set the column you want to update, so I just have to do name and age, rest its city, salary and customer id will remain the same So I did customer id 4, so the jam written in 4 will be replaced by xam, its age is 42, it will be replaced by 32, so let's run it once Now you will see that the query has been returned successfully, so let's check the data again So I will write, select star, I want everything, from customer, you do it ok Now you see that the jam was here, now it is xam, its age was 42 earlier, now it is 32, so in the same way you can update the existing values Now let's see how you can delete the values, so for this we use the delete statement and it deletes the existing record in the table So its syntax is delete, then from table, whatever is the name of your table, and you can delete it by putting the where condition So now we will see the example, so here you can see that I have written the query to delete, so the name of delete from customer table will come Where clause is put, customer id equals to 3, so this customer id equals to 3, this whole row will be deleted Ok, so now let's see, let's run it Now you see that the query has been returned successfully, now I will check the data again, now I will run it Now you see that only 3 rows of data are left, earlier it was 1, 2, now the 3 record is gone, so we have deleted it, after that 4th comes, so in this way you can delete the whole rows Next topic is of alter tables, so this statement helps you to delete the columns, to add them, to modify them in an existing table So the statement is alter table, now in alter table, 3 comes, so add column is the first, so its syntax is, you write alter table, write the name of the table, and add column, and the name of the column you want to put So that column will be added, after that, if you want, you can write data type and you can also add constraint Next comes alter table drop column, if you want to drop the column, means delete it, so for that you will do the same, alter table, name of the table After that drop column, above we wrote add column, here you will write drop column and the name of the column, so that column will be deleted, last comes, if you want to change the data type of the column already in you, so for that you will do alter table, alter column, and then you can write the name of the column and the new data type, so with this you will be assigned a new data type So we will not see the example of this, because it is very simple, so this is a kind of exercise for you, so you can try it This session's last topic comes, how to use drop and truncate table, so the drop table

want to add value from scratch, delete everything, delete everything, so you use truncate table, so let's see it as an example, so we have come to the database So let's go here and write truncate table, and which table is the customer, so the values you see will be deleted, only the names of the columns will remain, I will run it and show you, it came successfully, so now I tell it to do everything from the customer, now you will see a blank table, see As we made the starting, the name of the customer is columns, age, city, salary, but below the values are all blank, so this is truncate table, now you can start updating the values in it, now we have truncated, now I do drop table drop table customer, so the customer table you see here, it will disappear, so let's delete it, so drop means delete, I run it, it became successful, now I go to tables and refresh it, now you see there is only one table, go to tables, only one table is cust table, the customer table has been deleted, so in this way you can delete the table, so if you have any doubt in this video, then you can comment and tell me, I will reply to it, if you like this video, then you can give it a thumbs
