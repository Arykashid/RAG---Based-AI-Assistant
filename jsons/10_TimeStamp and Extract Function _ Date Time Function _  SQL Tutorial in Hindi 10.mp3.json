see what is timestamp So timestamp is a data type which has date and time So we call it timestamp And below that you can see different ways through which you can represent timestamp So first is your time So it contains time in it, obviously And its format is hours, minutes and second format And second is your date type So it stores your date and its format is year, month and then date And then it has year, so if you want to store only year data like 2022 So you can store in this format And if you want to store only last two digits like 2022 So you can use format for that And then comes timestamp, so it has date and time both Which we saw in the starting heading And in its format, you get date and time format together And in last comes time zone with timestamp So you can see date, time and time zone are contained in it And we call it timestamp TZ So these are some ways through which we represent timestamp And play with time and date After this we can see that timestamp has some functions or operators So you can see some examples here Like one is show time zone So it will tell you that in which time zone your SQL server is running After this comes select now, so it also tells you date and time Select time of day, then time current Then current time and current date We can run it in SQL and see what output we get And in most of the cases, these functions, timestamp functions or operators You use them when you are making your own database Means when you are making a database, then if you want to store data Then you will use these functions or operators So we are in SQL, here we run show time zone So you can see from the name, the time zone will show you So you can see that my SQL is running Its time zone is Asia, Calcutta So India's time zone is from Calcutta After that comes the second one, select now So if you run this So you can see here it has given you date First comes year, then month and then date So today as I am recording, it is 14th October 2022 And after that it is showing time here, 18, 13 and 01 second And after that it shows you the standard time zone After that you can see time of day So it will tell you what time is happening in the day and what is the date It tells you Friday, October month and then date And then it shows you the time After that if we run current time, it will only give you time So in output you can see 18, means 6 PM, 13 minutes and 49 seconds After that comes mini seconds And after that if we see current date, it will only give you date So you can see 2022, 10, 14 So you will mostly use this, suppose you are making your own database If you want to store only date in that table, like payment date Then you can use current time date So as soon as someone makes a payment, it will fill the current time or date in the database Similarly you can use current time and time of the day If you use now, it will give you date, time, year, month and everything with time zone And you mostly use time zone to see which zone is specific So these are your functions and operators related to time Now let's see what is extract function in SQL So you can see from the name of extract function That this extract function helps you to extract any part of any date or time So for that we use extract function And if you see its syntax, it is very simple Select, then you use extract And inside the bracket, whatever you want to extract Like if I have a date, any column of date I want to extract month from that, so you can write month If you want to do year or any other value, you can write that here And you can extract from table Now you can see below, what values you can extract from that Most of the time, the most common So you will use these data points a lot when you work in SQL When you work on real time data So let's practice this in SQL and see something So there is a table in SQL, named payment And there are 4 columns in it Customer ID, Amount, how much money is paid Mod, from which mode of transaction money is paid And lastly, payment date So let's apply extract function on this payment date So I say, like extract First of all, we do month From And now Payment date We save this with a name So I say as Payment month And let's put down from payment Let's write payment date on the side So that we can compare So you can see here It was 2029, 24th It was 9th month, so you can see here, it has extracted 9th month So in this way, you can use extract function Apart from this, if you want to use only year That you only want to extract year Here I am writing, pay year Let's run this So you can see here, where it was 2020 It has extracted 2020 Where it was 2021, it has extracted 2021 Right Apart from this, it will be very important if we write Day of week And I say, day of week Run So this day of week, it will tell you, which day is in week Means Sunday, Monday, Tuesday It will tell you So here, the date is Thursday So it has represented Thursday with 4 And here, you can see, 27th April That day is Monday Right, so in this way, you can take day of week Where 0 means Sunday Apart from this, if you want to extract time So you can do that too But in our case, there is no time Because you can see here, payment date is only date in column So it can't extract hours or minutes But apart from this, you can do something else Like I want to extract day Right, which day is it Means what is the date So you can see, it was 24th, so I have extracted 24th So if you want only day, you can extract date from here Apart from this, you can extract quarter Right, so I run quarter Now you can see, it is showing quarter too So your 9th month comes in 3rd quarter And your 4th month comes in 2nd quarter The 1st month comes in 1st quarter So in this way, you can see, you can extract quarter too So this is your extract function So we have done in SQL too So with the help of this, you can extract any date or time According to your use case"}
