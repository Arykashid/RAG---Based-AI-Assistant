" So now let's see how to use SELECT statement and WHERE clause in SQL Before that let's know what is SELECT statement So we use SELECT statement when we want to retrieve or read data from a database Like we use SELECT in English, same word is used here SELECT statement is used to select data from database And its syntax is SELECT, column name, FROM and table name This way you can select data If you want all data in a table, like columns, rows, etc. Then we use asterisk sign, which is SELECT star FROM table This way you can get all data And third thing which is used a lot with SELECT statement is DISTINCT DISTINCT means when you want unique values in a column Then you use DISTINCT Because it will remove all duplicate values and give you unique value So its syntax is SELECT, DISTINCT, COLUMN name, FROM and TABLE So let's understand it through an example So I am in a database, I write here SELECT everything FROM classroom So this is my table I am using asterisk sign, which means I want all data You select This is all data in the classroom table It has roll number, name, house and grade And it has data of 5 students So 5 rows of data So this way you can select all data if you use asterisk sign Now I want only some data So I want only 2 columns I want roll number and name So you write those 2 columns And run it Now you can see only 2 columns are coming Roll number and name Now if you want 3 columns So you write comma here GRADE And run it So you will get grade also So this way we can use SELECT statement Now let's see DISTINCT So I want to see which all grades are DISTINCT So run it Now you can see in our entire data table There are only 2 grades, A and B Means all are students So this way you can find DISTINCT and UNIQUE values Now let's see what is WHERE clause So actually we use WHERE clause when we want to filter data So we can filter data by putting condition in table And here it is written It is used to extract only those records that fulfill the specified condition So whatever condition you put in it, it will filter the data and show you Its syntax is SELECT column name FROM table After that WHERE and the condition you will write So here we write WHERE and whatever condition you want to write So let's see this example So here I have written that statement in SQL Before running it, let's understand the statement SELECT name So from this table, it will only pick name column This second column After that FROM classroom Table name is done WHERE grade equals to A So it will show only those students whose grade is A So before running it, let's see There are only 2 students One is RAM And second is SUNDAR These are 2 students So let's run it Now you see only 2 names are there RAM and SUNDAR So this way we use WHERE clause So when we want to use more than one condition in WHERE clause So for that we use operators So let's see the definition of operators So the words reserved in SQL or the characters reserved We call them operators And we mostly use this with WHERE clause So you get many operators in this There are different types of operators But the most used operators are 4 Which you will use the most in SQL One is Arithmetic Operators Second is Comparison Operators Third is Logical Operators And fourth is Bitwise Operators So what is Arithmetic You can understand it from the name Arithmetic operations are used on your integer value or numerical values So there are some examples of it Like addition, plus symbol, subtraction, minus symbol In this way, multiplication, division and modulus And what is Comparison Operator It is used to compare any 2 data So for example, we put sign of equals to Not equals sign Greater than, less than Smaller than, greater than All these signs And the third is Logical Operators In this, you perform Boolean operations Like you use all condition, in condition, between condition So if it is false, it will not give data If it is true, it will give you data in the output Then comes Bitwise Operators So what you do in this The bit operation you perform on the integer value Then we use Bitwise Operators Like AND and OR So for Bitwise AND, we use AND symbol And for Bitwise OR, we use single pipe So let's do an example So the last statement we used for where clause In that, we put AND condition So I write AND And here I say, the roll number is Greater than 3 So bigger than 3 If someone has A grade in 4 or 5, then he should tell me Let's run it Only one answer should come That is Sundar So you can see, only one child's name has come Which is Sundar So here we have used two conditions If I want all the data Like Sundar's name, roll number, grade, everything So here you put star And then run it So you see, now all the data is given Roll number is 4 Because we had taken condition Roll number should be greater than 3 So it will not include 3, but greater than 3 So there is only one child in it, Sundar, whose grade is A And that is Agni House So all the details come like this So like this, you can use multiple conditions In where clause So like we have put two conditions in where clause Where grade is equal to A and roll number is greater than 3 If you want to put more conditions Then you can write AND here And add that condition So you can put as many conditions as you want So like we are learning where clause So there are two more clauses With where clause One is limit clause and other is order by So you will use it a lot So let's see it quickly So limit clause helps you To see how many rows you want to see When you want to go to output And order by clause helps you to sort the data So let's understand it through an example So as you can see There is a table named customer So now this data is sorted on the basis of customer ID So now I want it to be sorted on the basis of name So what I will do Select everything here From and I will say Order by First name If you want ascending Then you will write ASC And if you want descending then you will write DESC So I want ascending So you can see that Mary is on top It will change now Let's run Now you can see that Barbara is on top Because there is no one above B Then there is B, then D, then E And at last S So like this you can sort the data with the help of order by And if we talk about limit So as you can see There is a top 5 data And if I use limit And I say 5 Sorry limit And I write 5 If you run it, then it will show only 5 rows of data Let's run it Now you can see that it is showing only top 5 So this is the use of limit"}
