"end": 451.44, "text": " But most of the time you will work on these"}], "text": " So now let's see what are string functions in SQL Before that let's know what are functions So in simple language, let me tell you about functions So these are some keywords or objects which are already fed in SQL and they help you to achieve a particular task So in this, as you can see in the last function accepts a parameter in input value and performs an action on it and finally gives you a result in output Now if we talk in broad sense, there are two types of functions First is your system defined function You can understand by the name, the functions which are already defined in the system or you can call them as built-in functions and you can see some examples of this rand, round, upper, lower, all these are built-in functions means the system already knows what is the meaning of these keywords and what operation I have to do After that, the second type of functions are user defined functions So if you want to make any function by yourself then you can define it by yourself and in future whenever you call that function then it will help you to achieve your task Now let's see what are string functions So string functions means the functions which you perform on strings they are called string functions Now what is string? We have already discussed this in data types Strings are your alphanumeric values or special characters all those come under strings Now I have written some most used string functions here As you can see it is upper So it will make all the alphabetical values in upper case and will make it in lower case Length will tell you in that whole text field or how many characters are there in that whole value Substring is actually if you want some part of a string if you want its subset then you use substring for that Now function helps you to give date time After that you have format function, concatenate, replace, trim functions So you will use this most of the time There are other functions too So let's see that now So I have come to the official website of PostgreSQL You can see here There is a dedicated document called string functions and operators And all the string functions which are applied in PostgreSQL All of them are given to you Like you can use concatenate for concatenate Bit length, character length, lower which we have seen, normalized So there are many functions like this So you can see all the functions in this And you can apply them according to your use So if you want to go to this page So you can write string functions and operators If you write PostgreSQL then it will come first on Google Otherwise I will paste this link in the description So you can go to this link from there too So let's implement some string functions in SQL So I already have a customer table in SQL Which has 5 columns So let's implement it So the first one is upper So let's do one thing First of all write upper After that you can upper any field or column So like I want to do first name So I want all the values of first name to come in upper Let's run this Now you will see Mary, Patrika, Linda Now all these are in full capital words Now there are no small characters in it So this is how you use upper If you do lower Then all will come in small Mary, Patrika, Linda Now all these are in small characters Similarly if you want to find the length of this So for length we use length And now I do one more thing with this Here I write First name So that it will be easy to compare Now you can see there are 4 characters in Mary So here 4 is written If there is 8 in Patrika then 8 is written There is 5 in Linda There is 7 in Barbara There is 9 in Elizabeth So this will give you the length of all characters length function There are other functions which can be used So let's use substring This is very interesting You will use this a lot If I write substring First name So what happens in substring I am saying that the first name You can see first name column In this from 1 to 3 Give me all the strings that are coming in it Means give me its subset So let's run this You can see I have written 1,2,3 So in Mary Mar are the starting words That's why you can see Mar In Patrika you can see Pat That's why it is Pat In Linda you can see Lin That's why it is Lin top 3 Now if you want you can increase it Like I say I only need 2 characters I do one thing I say I need characters from 2nd to 4th Now run this Now you can see it will not give M Because I started from 2 So on 2 you can see A So it is taking from A to ARY Because I need till 4 Now actually only 3 words are left in it That's why 3 is coming In Patrika P will not come It is from 2nd to A So you can see A T R I Similarly in Linda it is picked up from I So you play with these parameters You can take any part of substring Now we see next Next comes in it like Concatenate So let's see concatenate Here I write concat Write in capital Concat I have to concatenate first name With last name Right And you can also keep first name and last name together It will be easy to compare From customer Right I want to concatenate first name and last name And I want first name and last name separately Let's run it Now you see what it did Mary Smith was first name Mary Last name was Smith It wrote it together Concatenated it Patrika Johnson was also written together Linda Williams was also written together So concatenate any 2 text Concatenate means to merge Or you can say To paste No logic is used in it To paste directly we use concatenate After this comes your replace So write instead of concatenate Replace I have to do it in first name So first you give field name So field is mine first name I want here where ever Mary is written I will keep string in quotes Replace Mary with Mohan Right And rest first name and last name will do Let's run it Now you can see first name was Mary Now in replace you see Mohan Rest will be as it is So if you want to replace a value Then you use replace function And last comes your trim So you will use trim a lot It will be used in data cleaning Trim is used after any word Suppose after Mary someone has written Two spaces So this will also count in character length If you see length then it will not be 4 but 6 Because here is one and second is here So it will be 6 length So if you use trim function It will remove extra spaces And make it 4 Similarly if there is any extra space in front It will remove it by default So in that case you use trim function There are other string functions Which you will use It will depend on your use case But most of the time you will work on these"}
