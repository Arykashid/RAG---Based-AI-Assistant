as you practice, your joins will be cleared"}], "text": " In this video we will talk about Joins If you have not learned about Joins in SQL then it means you have not learned anything because Joins is a very important topic in SQL and when you will work on a real time project then you will definitely use Joins because the data is not stored in one table it is stored in multiple tables and for that we use Joins and if you are learning Joins for the first time in SQL then trust me these videos will be very important for you because in this video we will cover the basics we will cover the types of Joins what types of Joins are there which Joins are used when what is the syntax of it how to use it in SQL we will see the example in SQL and we will cover everything step by step in this video so the word Join means Combine to join something we call it Join so when we talk about Join in SQL we combine two or more tables means combine and we combine on a common column so suppose I have two tables, table A and table B if I want to combine these two tables in SQL, means join then two or more columns should be common in these two columns means the same values in this column should be in the other table then only I can join this table, otherwise not so if you see its by definition then a Join clause is used to combine data from two or more tables based on related column between them so let's understand this through an example so here you can see the question how much amount was paid by customer Madan and what was the mode and payment date so before going to this question let me explain you what is in this slide so here you can see there is a database in which there are four tables the first table is your customer table second is payment third is address table and fourth is country table these four are connected with common columns now see our question in that we have given customer name means it will be first name customer table other than that the question is how much amount was paid and what was the mode and payment date so if you see this, there are all details in payment table so if I join these two tables then I will get all the details in front of customer name now let's see the values of both tables so now you can see both tables so the first table is customer table and the second table is payment table so in customer table, there is customer ID first name, last name and address ID, there are four columns in payment also there are four columns customer ID, amount, mode and payment date so there are four columns now the question you can see on right side that customer is Madan so in first table, first name is Madan, and his customer ID is 2 we have highlighted it in red now in second table customer ID is 2 if you go further, then in that amount, mode and payment, you will get all three things so what we did we saw from first name that what is customer ID and ID was common in both columns so from there we found out the rest of the values and if we join here, then customer ID is common in both tables so if I want to join these two tables then I can join both tables with customer ID now how to do it what type of join is it we will see that later so now you can see how many types of join are there so here we have only told you the high level of types and their definition and details we will see in the coming slides so the first join is inner join second most used join is left then right join and full join so this left join is also called left outer join right join is also called right outer join and full join is also called full outer join the four diagrams you can see below is called Venn diagram we will understand it one by one so first let's talk about inner join so inner join helps you to give common values between two tables so we will understand it with the help of Venn diagram and set up Venn diagram in your mind so that it will be easy for you to visualize so you can see first I have two tables in circle one table A and one table B so when we bring both circles together the common area of both circles that represents your inner join common area means the common elements between two tables the values that will come we can pull them through inner join now on the right side we can see the inner join we are showing it visually we have two tables so let's understand it properly I have paused the video now you can see I have one table which has three values one, two, three and their respective values so I have a table B which has one, two, four and it has values y1, y2 and y4 if I inner join both of them then the common elements will come to me now what is common in both of them one is in both tables so one will come two is in both tables so two will come in output but three is not in both tables and four is not in both tables so it will not come in output now if you play it then you can see the output one came, two came their respective values were x1, x2 and in the other table their values were y1, y2 so the values we have joined these values are called inner join I hope it will be clear from here now let's take it one step ahead if it is still not clear then let's do it practically before that let's see the syntax how we apply join in SQL so here you can see the syntax of inner join first of all we write the name of select column as we have done till now now to join here it is obvious that there should be more than one table so first of all we have written the name of table so we are calling it table A after that you specify the type of join in all joins all types of joins have same syntax only here the name of join is defined by this so here it is written inner join with whom we have to do inner join? with table B how to do it? we will tell you in the line below table A.column name is equal to table B.column name now here one thing to be noted that the names of both columns should be same suppose here the column is customer id so table A.customer id is equal to table B.customer id if the values are not same in both columns then the join will not work and you will not get any result in output and this inner join here like table A and table B if I change them if I write table B first and table A later then also my output will be same because we are taking common elements from both tables so if it is common then you can take it first your result will be same now we will see its example in sql so here you can see that I have a table with customer name, in which customer id is there first name, last name and address id and I have another table whose name is payment now let's run it so you can see that in payment there is customer id then amount then mod, in mod it will tell you how you transferred money cash, credit card or mobile payment and last is payment date which date you have paid if I want to join these two tables with the help of inner join then the common id the common column with which I can join is customer id so I have two tables, customer and payment so let's join them so I will write select everything from customer table and here I am writing as c and this as c we call it alias in sql and this gives you a temporary name because I don't want to write customer again and again so I am writing only c so it makes representation easy and here we have to join inner join, so I will say inner join you have to give table b so table b is mine payment, we have to do it on payment and I will call it as p you can give any name I am giving a single word after that how to join, I have told you type of join is inner join, how to do I am telling you, you can write c.customer underscore id is equal to p.customer underscore id I have to join star means I want all columns from both tables, so let's join now you can see in output, there are only two rows of data only two rows one is customer id and other is two because you have another table you can see, another table has started customer id, amount, mod and if you go to right side payment date, so these four columns are from table 2, payment table so here only two rows of data are coming because in both tables only two customers are common customer id is one and customer id is two rest in both tables there are customers of different customer id so in inner join, that data is not coming so this way we use inner join if you don't want all rows you can mention here as we have seen in previous videos apart from this, if you want to add any condition, group by or where clause, so you can do all that as it is, there is no problem you can use all those conditions with join suppose I want to pick only one column so I write c.first underscore name and from payment I want p.amount and I say p.mod so let's run so now you can see in output only three columns are coming first name, amount and mod because I have specified here before this we had written star and second thing, why I have written c. or p. that is because, it has two functions one is database, SQL it will understand which table you want to pick from now both tables have unique columns but in future it may happen that same name is in different tables so for that we will specify pick first name from customer pick amount from payment and pick mod from payment second benefit is, tomorrow your code is seen by another person or another person works on that code so he will understand which table and which column you are picking so his life will be easy, so this is a kind of standard way of writing SQL code now let's see, what are the other types of SQL joins now after inner join the most used join is left join so most of the time you will work with inner join and left join so what is left join? in left join you get all the data which is in left table and it matches with right table, if it doesn't match with right table, then it will give you null values but you will get all the data of left table in output you can understand this from Venn diagram table A is here and table B is here but all data of table A is colored which means you will get all values of table A in output if we learn this with the help of diagram so let's pause it so here you can see in left join I have 3 rows of data in left side which has 1, 2, 3 3 values if I talk about right table, then it has 1, 2, 4 not 3 and we are doing left join so what will be in output all values of table A will be there 1, 2, 3 but table B will pick up the values which are common in table A like 1 is in both 2 is in both but 4 is not there, so it will not pick up 4 values in output let's play it so you can see, this is join and here you can see the output 1, 2, 3 this was in table A, which means left table was everything, in right you had 4 that is not in output so the one which is not in left table will not pick up in output in that case we use left join now let's see the syntax so let's see the syntax so here also similar to inner join the syntax is same first you select column name then from table A then which type of join you want so we will say left join table B after that you have to tell how to join so I want table A dot column like in previous join I told you that you can write table A or table B in any order but here it will not be like that in left or right join you have to take care of this whatever is your first table you will write, your join will work on that so I have written table A first so my left will be table A and the one in right side will be table B so you have to take care of this so I have written table A dot column name equal to table B dot column name column name should be same values should be same and here is the example so let's run the example so here we have written the same query select star from customer which we are saying as C and left join last time we did inner, this time left join payment table here we have declared payment table as P so how to join C dot customer ID is equal to P dot customer ID this means what you can see below this is my left table this is my customer table this will remain as it is there will be no error if that customer ID 1 is there in right 2 will be there, if not then it will be null let's run it so you can see my left table is as it is these 4 columns are of left table customer, name, first name last name and address ID all are as it is, what is happening in right is changing in right so you can see the change in right customer 1 and customer 2 are matching but 3 and 4 are not there so what is it doing it is giving null values here will be blank values, rest of the data will be matched, you will get it amount, mod, payment date this is your left join in right join, same to same will happen all data of right table will be there but in left table, only that will be there which is common with right let's understand this then we will run it in right join, all data will be there which is in right table and which is common with left table and which is not common will be null values here you can see Venn diagram table A and table B, if we take table B as right table it is fully colored this is your Venn diagram let's understand right side diagram here you can see in right join, I have 2 tables table A has 1, 2, 3 values table B has 1, 2, 4 values so the output of right join in right join, my right table will be as it is so 1, 2, 4 will be as it is there will be no change in it 3 will not come because 3 is not in right side so we will remove 3 1 will come, 2 will come, both are common let's play it see the output you can see the output, I have 1, 2, 4 because it was in right side 3 will not come, 3 was in left table but not in right, so we will drop it and here the respective values are there I had no value of 4 in left side so it is null rest both x1 and x2 values are there so this is our right join let's see its syntax its syntax is same as left join just type of join will be left join rest everything will be same keep in mind table A and table B which you are joining their position also depends on how will be the output if you swap, then output will change let's run this example this was our last example everything will be same just left will be replaced by right now let's run it as I told you in right table, all data will be there customer id is right side but not in left so you can see 1 and 2 are in left but in right side customer id is 8, 10 and 11 and not in left so it is blank it is null so this is our right join now let's talk about last join which is called outer join so last join is full join or we also call it full outer join so you can understand full join means table A and table B which you will get for that we use full join here you can see definition returns all records when there is a match in either of the right or left table if you get any data in any of the two it will give you in output table A and table B are colored if we understand it with the help of diagram so you can see I have two tables, table A and table B in table A I have values 1, 2 and 3 in table B I have values 1, 2 and 4 now if we join both of them so you can see output so you can see output is 1, 2, 3, 4 it took 1, 2, 3 from left table and 4 value was in right table so it merged both the tables and wrote the values and left the values blank which means null values let's see the syntax of this syntax is same select column name from table A here you will write full outer join so in postgresql we write full outer join it has table B name and how you will join same table A.column name is equal to table B.column name in this also your writing sequence is same to same inner join you can keep table A in front and table B in back it will not affect your output let's run this example so here in sql where we wrote right join you have to write full outer join rest everything as it is now run this now see the output all the data in both the tables you can see here I had 4 rows of data in table A now see here customer id 1, customer id 2 customer id 3, customer id 4 4 rows the data in middle is null because in right side there was some data which was not common in left you can see that customer id 8, customer id 10 and customer id 11 in last 3 and 4 are not in right side table so it is blank so whatever data is not matched it will be blank so you get all the rows in outer join or in full join so this is your full join so this is your 4 types of major joins we saw the definitions and syntax of it and finally we learned it with the help of examples now I will tell you in high level that which join to use when it will depend on your use case if you want data in left table then you will use left join if you want data which is common in both the tables I don't want null values you will use inner join and you will use right join when you need data in right table and if you use outer join then you will use outer join when you need all the data in both the tables so here I am telling you that whenever you want to revise the joins you can take the help of this sheet here you can see all the joins are explained and their syntax is also given so you can do quick revision in one page so I hope you have cleared some of the joins and as you practice, your joins will be cleared"}
